        <h4 lang="en">Description</h4>
        <p>
            A nutritious, hearty hotpot rich with the broth from the huge scorpion. The scorpion meat, walking mushroom,
            and various tubers and vegetables are soft and flavourful, while the dried slime noodles add interesting texture.
            Made up entirely of ingredients from the first floor of the dungeon, this dish is both beginner-friendly and 
            delicious.

        <h4 lang="en">Ingredients</h4>
        <p lang="en"><em>serves 3-4</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Huge scorpion</li>
            <li>1 Walking mushroom</li>
            <li>2 Walking mushroom legs</li>
            <li>Algae weedmoss as needed</li>
            <li>5 Reverse tubers, medium-sized</li>
            <li>Dried slime to taste</li>
            <li>Water as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the scorpion.</strong></li>
            <p>Remove the head, legs, and tail. Divide the body into equal 8-10 parts, which will cook the pieces
                faster and allow its juices to seep into the broth. Remove the innards as they are bitter and
                undesirable. (Optionally, pickle them and serve as toppings with rice.)</p>

            <li><strong>Prepare the walking mushroom.</strong></li>
            <p>Remove the outer three inches of the body and rear, and cut vertically to size.
                Keep its feet, as they are a delicacy.</p>

            <li><strong>Prepare the slime.</strong></li>
            <p>Wash the defeated slime with hot water, with a bit of citric juice added. Squeeze out the excess
                water and moisture, or salt to dry. Hang for ~2 weeks for the best results. Thinly slice the dried
                product into noodles.</p>

            <li><strong>Prepare the vegetables.</strong></li>
            <p>Peel the reverse tubers' skin thinly with a knife, then roughly chop to size. Wash the algae
                weedmoss for any debris.</p>

            <li><strong>Add the ingredients to the pot.</strong></li>
            <p>In a large pot, add the scorpion meat and mushroom. Add the reverse tubers, algae weedmoss,
                and dried slime. Add water and bring to a boil, seasoning the broth as it cooks.</p>

            <li><strong>Making the hotpot.</strong></li>
            <p>Cover the pot to cook until the scorpion meat is bright red and cooked thoroughly, separating
                easily from its shell. Serve in the pot as is, and enjoy!</p>
