        <li>3 medium <em>baraselia</em> fruit</li>

    <h4 lang="en">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the crust.</strong></li>
        <p lang="en">Lightly steam all fruit. Remove the stem and core of the <em>baraselia</em> by cutting a
        circle under the stalk and twisting and pulling the seeds out. Hit the skin of the fruit until tender,
        and line a cast iron pan with them to create the crust.</p>

        <li><strong>Prepare the fruit.</strong></li>
        <p lang="en">Roughly chop the <em>mearauk</em> and <em>betahn</em> fruit. Set some aside for garnish.</p>

        <li><strong>Make the filling.</strong></li>
        <p lang="en">Mash up the <em>baraselia</em> fruit, adding slime gelatin and some of the scorpion broth.
        Stir until thick and smooth. Once smooth, add the rest of the broth and chopped fruit. Mix to combine.</p>

        <li><strong>Bake the tart.</strong></li>
        <p lang="en">Pour the mixture into the lined cast iron pan. Let heat until the surface begins to bubble.
            Garnish with remaining fruit, and enjoy!</p>
